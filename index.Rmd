### For problem 2

I used NY NOAA dataset. These data were accessed from the NOAA National Climatic Data Center. The dataset ny_noaa contains variables:  
id: Weather station ID  
date: Date of observation  
prcp: Precipitation (tenths of mm)  
snow: Snowfall (mm)  
snwd: Snow depth (mm)  
tmax: Maximum temperature (tenths of degrees C)  
tmin: Minimum temperature (tenths of degrees C)  
Each weather station may collect only a subset of these variables, and therefore the resulting dataset contains extensive missing data.
